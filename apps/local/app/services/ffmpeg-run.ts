/**
 * Run a long-lived ffmpeg encode with real progress reporting.
 *
 * `-progress pipe:1` makes ffmpeg emit key=value progress blocks on
 * stdout (which nothing else uses), parsed incrementally into integer
 * percents of `totalDurationSeconds` (see createFfmpegProgressParser for
 * the emission contract). `-nostats` drops the carriage-return stats
 * line from the inherited stderr, which otherwise duplicates the same
 * numbers as terminal noise.
 *
 * Runs under a scope, so fiber interruption (SSE disconnect, cancelled
 * publish) kills the child; the PID is also registered with the
 * parent-death backstop (see ffmpeg-child-registry) for the case where
 * the dev server itself dies without interrupting any fiber.
 *
 * Both stdout (progress) and stderr (diagnostics) are piped rather than
 * inherited, and BOTH are drained concurrently via a single
 * `Effect.all`. That concurrency is load-bearing, not incidental: a
 * piped OS stream that nobody reads fills its buffer (~64KB) and blocks
 * the writer, so draining stdout to completion before even starting to
 * drain stderr would recreate, on stderr, the exact hang this function
 * exists to prevent on stdout.
 *
 * Each drained chunk is handled in isolation — a throw anywhere
 * downstream of `onProgress` (most plausibly an SSE controller whose
 * client has gone away) must never stop that stream's loop. If it did,
 * nobody would read that pipe again, ffmpeg's next write to it would
 * block on a full buffer, and the encode would hang forever — a hang
 * invisible to `Effect.retry`, since a process that never exits never
 * resolves to a failure to retry.
